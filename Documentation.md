<strong><p>Symbol of Linux</p></strong>

<p>Linux, heavily influenced by UNIX, leverages many of its concepts. It accesses features and services primarily through files and file-like objects, providing a multi-tasking, multi-user environment with integrated networking and daemon services.</p>

<p>Developed by a global collaboration of developers led by Linus Torvalds, Linux encourages participation based on technical skill and a desire to contribute. The Linux community includes a vast ecosystem of developers, vendors, and users who support and advance the operating system.</p>

<p>Key Linux terms include kernel, distribution, boot loader, service, filesystem, X Window system, desktop environment, and command line. A complete Linux distribution comprises the kernel and various software tools for file operations, user management, and software package management.</p>

<h2>LINUX BASICS AND SYSTEM STARTUP</h2>

<p>A partition is a logical segment of a disk, allowing data to be grouped and separated for better organization and protection. A filesystem, which is a method of storing and locating files on a hard disk, operates within these partitions. By partitioning a disk, any failure or mistake is contained within the affected partition, preserving data on other partitions.</p>

<p>The Linux boot process involves multiple steps: starting with BIOS, which triggers the boot loader to launch the Linux kernel. This leads to invoking the initramfs filesystem, which then triggers the init program to complete the startup process.</p>

<p>Selecting the appropriate Linux distribution requires aligning your system's specific needs with the capabilities of various distributions.</p>
